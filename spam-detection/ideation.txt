Potential Ideas:

Certain API Endpoints get accessed way more: check frequency of accessing
    Will have to go back to analytics and the actual logs to see if stuff is being spammed on repeat

Also could check IP address to see if it is a bot farm from an easily detectable service
    HUGE HUGE # come from an IP that has a domain name associated with AWS EC2

2 approaches I'm thinking about:
Unsupervised model:
    Will take in the log at the end of the day and then output weird IPs
    Focus on detecting outliers

Supervised:
    Takes the calls as they come in and blocks/flags IPs in real time
    Main problem is that I would need to know which IP addresses are spam ahead of time

INSIGHTS:
Some IP addresses associated w things that can host spam bots (AWS EC2)
Some API calls get spammed more often than others
